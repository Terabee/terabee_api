# Terabee API

Application Programming Interface for Terabee sensors. The idea is to simplify sensors usage on the client side by providing abstract layer between sensor communication protocol and client algorithms.

## To compile API

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## To install API in the system

Compile api and then

```
sudo make install
```

## To uninstall API from the system

Use the `install_manifest.txt` file. For example:

```
sudo rm `cat install_manifest.txt`
```

## To use installed API in a separate project

```
find_package(TerabeeApi REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example ${TerabeeApi_LIBRARIES})
target_include_directories(example PUBLIC ${TerabeeApi_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

## To generate doxygen documentation

Run the following command from inside the API folder:
```
doxygen
```

## To use in another ROS package (catkin worspace)

1. Add the API folder to the *src* folder of your workspace
2. In your *CMakelLists.txt*, add a find package statement:
```
find_package(
  catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  TerabeeApi
)
```
3. In the same file, also add *TerabeeApi* as a catkin dependency:
```
catkin_package(DEPENDS TerabeeApi)
```
4. In your *package.xml* add TerabeeApi as a build and exec dependency. for instance:
```
<build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
<build_depend>TerabeeApi</build_depend>
<exec_depend>TerabeeApi</exec_depend>
```
5. Follow the "To use installed API in a separate project" section for linking and including
